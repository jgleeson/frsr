Description: Functions to easily import microdata from Family Resources Survey 
    datasets that have been downloaded from the UK Data Service. When provided 
    with a folder where the FRS datasets are saved (including in sub-folders), 
    ehsr will identify and import data for the years you specify, 
    distinguishing between the household and housing stock datasets. It will 
    also standardise variable names and value labels where these have evolved 
    over time.
